# SDK4ED Dashboard

Welcome to the SDK4ED Dashboard repository. The dashboard is currently based on a free online template available at <https://mdbootstrap.com>.

The dashboard relies on [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building dynamic web pages with shareable elements among different pages.

Charts and plots will be visualized with [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/plotly-js-scientific-d3-charting-library/) which provides support for React and a series of other programming languages, including Python and R.

All of these libraries are provided under MIT License and thus free to use in the SDK4ED project.
